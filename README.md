Data was pulled from https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861m/. Each year was downloaded seperately from Sales & Revenue tab. I then cleaned field names in Excel before importing into R and merging the files into one dataframe.

The analysis was focused on calculating what local utilities were charging per unit, in order to quantify the marked increase in electricity bills. I was also able to calculate the average Florida electric bill and compare it to other states.
